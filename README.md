# Leetcode_Java

This repository contains my Java solutions to various Leetcode problems, organized by algorithm type and data structure. Each folder in the `src` directory corresponds to a specific topic or set of classic problems, making it easy to navigate and review solutions for interview preparation or algorithm practice.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WangZT01/Leetcode_Java.git
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or your favorite Java IDE.
3. Browse the `src` directory to find solutions by topic.
4. Each Java file contains code and comments explaining the approach.

## Topics Covered

- **Array:** Classic array manipulation, searching, and subarray problems.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Problems involving optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
- **Data Structures:** Stack, queue, heap, hash map, and custom data structure implementations.
- **Linked List:** Single and double linked list operations, cycle detection, reversal, etc.
- **Recursion:** Recursive solutions for combinatorial and divide-and-conquer problems.
- **Sorting:** Implementations of common sorting algorithms and related Leetcode problems.
- **String:** String parsing, pattern matching, and manipulation.
- **Top100F/Top75:** Curated lists of the most frequently asked and classic Leetcode problems.
- **Tree:** Binary tree, BST, and N-ary tree traversals and manipulations.
- **Two Pointers:** Fast/slow pointer and sliding window techniques.
- **Graph:** BFS, DFS, shortest path, and other graph algorithms.
- **Other:** Standalone solutions like `binarySearch_704.java`.
